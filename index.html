  <h1>FireStar</h1>
  <p>ok here is a bunch of posts that go through a step by step of how I start a friction fire.</p>
  <p>The process of starting a friction fire starts well before you ever start rubbing sticks together. When I walk in
    the woods I am taking note of materials around me that I could use to start a fire. Most of the time I'm just
    passively taking note of things, like standing deadwood, tinder sources, conifers (because they are soft wood), bone
    white dead wood (because that is often tulip poplar and good for friction fire). Once I decide I am going to make a
    friction fire I start actively looking for 3 main things. Tinder, a straight piece of softwood for the drill, and a
    softwood board that I can make a fireboard out of.</p>
  <div class="gallery">
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/01.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/01.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">In this first picture I can see conifers in the distance. I'll look there for standing
        deadwood that I can use for all 3 of the key things I need. Fireboard, drill and tinder.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/02.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/02.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">The trees are eastern red cedars. I don't need to know the name of the tree though, I just
        need to know if it has the proper characteristics. Is it soft enough where I can press my thumbnail into it. I
        haven't tried a conifer tree yet that wasn't good at friction fire. Cedar will provide me with all three of my
        key items. Cedar is a great wood for friction fire. It also provides us tinder.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/03.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/03.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">First I harvest tinder by peeling away the bark. This tree is standing deadwood. Standing
        deadwood is usually much drier than wood laying on the ground.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/04.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/04.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Here is a vine growing in the cedar with a nice papery bark. This will also be great for a
        tinder bundle.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/05.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/05.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Also scraping a dead cedar with the back of my knife produces a fine fluffy tinder. I'll put
        this in the center of my "bird's nest" of tinder.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/06.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/06.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Here is the material I've harvested for the bird's nest.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/07.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/07.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Next I process this material to increase it's surface area, by pulling the strands apart and
        rolling it in my hands to break it into a finer fluff. Then I form it into a bird's nest and put the finest
        fluff in the center. My burning ember will be placed here. Now it's time to move on to making the bowdrill set.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/08.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/08.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">I find a straight piece of cedar about 1 inch in diameter. Carve the piece to be as straight
        as possible if needed. Make the ends like a pencil...One end like the sharpened lead side and the other like a
        rounded eraser. The "eraser" side goes into the fireboard. The "lead" side goes into the bearing block. Don't
        skimp on any of these steps. Every component needs to be done the best you can to make this work smoothly.
        Tolerance stacking will result in no ember. Take your time.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/09.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/09.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Next is the fireboard. I found a piece of cedar that was on the ground but a long portion was
        elevated and not touching the ground. It was dry and had a natural split in it. Using two trees and levering it
        between them I snapped off a small section. Then I split the wood with its natural crack. Then I carved the
        rounded side to make it have three relatively flat sides.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/10.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/10.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Next I find any stick with a slight bow in it and I tie a string to it. Yes I carry cordage
        Usually wrapped around my knife sheath, often in my pocket, and in a worst case scenario I have shoestrings.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/11.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/11.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Next is the "bearing block." This is the component that can make or break your success. You
        can make a bearing block from natural materials. Fatwood is the best for me and is usually easy to find. Or you
        can use a green hardwood. But I carry this indented quarter on my knife so I'm going to use it. There is another
        way to use a regular flat coin too, but I won't go into that here.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/12.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/12.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">I found this chunk of wood on the ground and secured the coin to it. The "lead" end of our
        pencil shaped drill will go into the coin and spin freely against the metal.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/13.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/13.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Next, I carve a very small divot with my knife and then do an initial "burn in" with the bow
        drill.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/14.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/14.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">After that I carve a notch into the divot. Don't go too far. The center is too far. Don't
        make the notch too narrow either. It is better to be too wide than too narrow. Coal dust will fill this hole and
        then form an ember from the heat of friction. A small leaf is placed under the notch to catch the ember. i will
        then dump the glowing ember from the leaf to the bird's nest.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/15.webm" data-fancybox="gallery" data-type="html5video">
        <img src="img/15.jpg" alt="Video thumbnail" />
      </a>
      <div class="caption">After the ember is made I remove the fireboard and the ember is left smoking on the leaf.
        There is no need to rush. Sorry I couldn't show video of the bowdrill process, but that is not what this post is
        about.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/16.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery"><img src="img/16.jpg" /></a>
      <div class="caption">Next I put the smoking ember into the bird's nest.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="image-caption-pair">
      <a href="img/17.webm" data-fancybox="gallery" data-type="html5video">
        <img src="img/17.jpg" alt="Video thumbnail" />
      </a>
      <div class="caption">Then I fold the bundle around the ember and blow it into flame. Sorry the video is not
        better, but it was difficult to hold the camera and see the screen while blowing the tinder bundle into flame.
        So there is friction fire. It takes a good bit of time to find the materials and build everything properly. With
        practice though you can have confidence that you can start a fire with nothing but a knife, your shoelace, and
        some knowledge.</div>
